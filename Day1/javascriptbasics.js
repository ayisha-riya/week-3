   //what is js?
//----------------
//java script is a highlevel interpreted programming language that makes webpages interactive and dynamic
//interpreted programming language means excuting line by line
//->HTML gives structure
//->CSS gives style
//->JS adds behaviour


   //RUnning js
//----------------
//another programming languages compiler to convert code into machine code before running
//But js is don't need any separate compiler.js need only js Engine
//in the Browser the engine is already built-in
   //-Chrome-V8
   //-Firefox-spidermonkey
   //-Safari-javascrptCore
//That's why just write <script> in HTML and it works directly

   //Node.js
//-------------  
//the same V8 engine is provided outside the browser
//so we cam run js on computer or server(Backend),not just in web pages

//Install it(just next->next->finish)
